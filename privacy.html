                                        the necessary steps to protect your personal information as much as possible in transit by using technical and administrative security measures to reduce the risks of loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure
                                        and alteration of personal data. Some of the safeguards we use are firewalls and very strict data encryption which include: 3 level of encryptions, physical access controls on every network point, and information
                                        access authorization controls. Such protection is currently obtained by using: database encryption aes-256 algorithms, physical access controls (PAC), and information access authorization controls.</li>
